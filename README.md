# Up(today)te

Uptodayte is a news aggregation and visualization tool that collects relevant news articles that took place within the last 24 hours.

* Articles are represented by markers that are overlayed on a world map, indicating the location in which the story took place
* Clicking on a marker will show more details about the story or event that took place at that marker location
* If users only need a quick preview of the story, hovering over the marker with a cursor will reveal a tooltip containing the title of the news article
* "What did I miss?!" feature contains a short summary of all the relevant information that occured in the past day
